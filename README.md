# Demonstration code
This contains several programs for demonstration purposes

## hex directory
Has a c++ implementation of the game hex
using threaded Monte Carlo simulation.
Concepts include these graph algorithms:
* Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
* Prim Minimum Spanning Tree
* Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path
* Union Find

## maximum_path_sum directory
Has a solution to the maximum sum of a non forked path in a binary tree.
I found it interesting because some of the solutions on the internet are deficient.
Concepts include:
* pretty printing binary tree
* testing for maximum sum invariance under left right symmetry and tree rotation
