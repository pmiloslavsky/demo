# Demonstration code
This contains several programs for demonstration purposes

## hex directory
Has a c++ implementation of the game hex
using threaded Monte Carlo simulation.
Concepts include these graph algorithms:
* Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
* Prim Minimum Spanning Tree
* Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path
* Union Find

## maximum_path_sum directory
Has a solution to the maximum sum of a non forked path in a binary tree.
I found it interesting because some of the solutions on the internet are deficient.
Concepts include:
* pretty printing binary tree
* testing for maximum sum invariance under left right symmetry and tree rotation

## parallel_algorithms directory
Looks at C++17 STL sort and reduce using par,seq,par_unseq execution policies.
Also looks at ways of writing code that make algorithms unparallelizable
and unvectorizable.
Conclusion:
* time your code any time you use an execution policy
* vector size may affect whether or not there is an improvement
