# Demonstration code
This contains several programs for demonstration purposes


## ode_simulation directory
C++ 3D particle and trail simulation of many strange attractor ordinary
differential equations. It was written using sfml and tgui libraries.
Features include:
* Zoomable,rotatable (Euler Angle sliders (Theta)), translatable frame of reference
* Various keyboard and mouse and gui controls for things like DE parameters
* Changeable particle and trail settings
* Skinned modern GUI elements (Sliders, Button, Menus, etc)
* Escaped particle detection
* On Screen Axes to indicate rotation
* Screenshots via hotkey
* Hide all widgets via hotkey
* Color maps that color the trails and particles
* Textures for moving circles

## lorenz_3d_simulation directory
An earlier version of the ode_simulation

## hex directory
Has a c++ implementation of the game hex
using threaded Monte Carlo simulation.
Concepts include these graph algorithms:
* Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
* Prim Minimum Spanning Tree
* Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path
* Union Find

## maximum_path_sum directory
Has a solution to the maximum sum of a non forked path in a binary tree.
I found it interesting because some of the solutions on the internet are deficient.
Concepts include:
* pretty printing binary tree
* testing for maximum sum invariance under left right symmetry and tree rotation

## max_connected_color_count directory
This is a harder variant of the flood fill algorithm. We have to find the biggest chunk of 4-way connected colors in the grid and return number of elements in the connected chunk. We dont use recursion. We end up using a tailored Union Find algorithm and memoizing the counts of joined sets in the set heads.

## parallel_algorithms directory
Looks at C++17 STL sort and reduce and for_each using seq,unseq,par,par_unseq execution policies.
Also looks at ways of writing code that make algorithms unparallelizable
and unvectorizable.
Conclusion:
* time your code any time you use an execution policy
* vector size may affect whether or not there is an improvement
