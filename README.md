# Demonstration code
This contains several individual and larget programs for demonstration purposes

## hex directory
has a c++ implementation of the game hex
using threaded Monte Carlo simulation
Concepts include these graph algorithms:
* Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
* Prim MST
* Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path
* Union Find

## maximum_path_sum directory
has a solution to the maximum non forked path in a binary tree
I found it interesting because some of the solutions on the internet are deficient
Concepts include:
* pretty printing binary tree
* testing for maximum sum invariance under left right symmetry and tree rotation
