c++ implementation of the game hex
using threaded Monte Carlo simulation.
Concepts include these graph algorithms:
* Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree
* Prim Minimum Spanning Tree
* Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path
* Union Find

To build:

install g++

Makefile:
Code has some optional demo features that use python that have been
commented out.
If you want to put them back in, you will need to comment in the python
things in the Makefile
