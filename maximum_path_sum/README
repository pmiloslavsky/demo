"Maximum Path Sum"
Has a solution to the maximum sum of a non forked path in a binary tree.
I found it interesting because some of the solutions on the internet are deficient.
Concepts include:
* pretty printing binary tree
* testing for maximum sum invariance under left-right symmetry and tree rotation
  (rotation chages it)
