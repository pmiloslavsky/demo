C++ 3D particle and trail simulation of many strange attractor ordinary
differential equations. It was written using sfml and tgui libraries.
Features include:
* Zoomable,rotatable (Euler Angle sliders (Theta)), translatable frame of reference
* Various keyboard and mouse and gui controls for things like DE parameters
* Changeable particle and trail settings
* Skinned modern GUI elements (Sliders, Button, Menus, etc)
* Escaped particle detection
* On Screen Axes to indicate rotation
* Screenshots via hotkey
* Hide all widgets via hotkey
* Color maps that color the trails and particles
* Textures for moving circles
