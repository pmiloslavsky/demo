"C++17 STL parallel and vectorizable algorithms"
Looks at C++17 STL sort and reduce using seq,unseq,par,par_unseq execution policies.
Also looks at ways of writing code that make algorithms unparallelizable
and unvectorizable.
Conclusion:
* time your code any time you use an execution policy
* vector size may affect whether or not there is an improvement
